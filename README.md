## CSCAR Numpy workshop

This site contains materials for a [CSCAR](cscar.research.umich.edu)
workshop on [Numpy](www.numpy.org).

## Installation

If you are using a scientific Python distribution like
[Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/) or
[Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/) you already have
Numpy.  If you have a bare Python distribution or for some reason need
to reinstall or upgrade your Numpy installation, you can use pip on
the command line:

```
pip install numpy --upgrade
```
